# VoidEcho  
*A fast-paced survival arena game built with the Ursina engine.*

---

## 🎮 About the Game  
In **VoidEcho**, you awaken in a strange world—trapped in a hostile arena with nothing but a gun, a handful of bullets, and a knife. Every wave of enemies pushes you closer to the edge, forcing you to manage your limited ammo and fight for survival.  

- Kill enemies to earn bullets (+5 per kill).  
- Survive waves to earn bigger rewards (+25 bullets every 5 waves).  
- Enemies increase by **+3 per wave until wave 5**, balancing challenge and performance.  
- Each milestone increases difficulty, wave cooldowns, and your ability to adapt.  
- Rack up your score, beat your high score, and survive as long as possible.

- **Progressive difficulty**: scaling enemy count and rewards.  
- **Dynamic soundtrack** featuring NCS and royalty-free tracks.

💡 Developer's Note
VoidEcho is more than just a game project—it’s a blend of three of my favorite things:

Music – creating a playlist-driven atmosphere with intense tracks that fuel the action.

Programming – building mechanics and learning from challenges like packaging and asset integration.

Games – my love for playing and designing experiences that test skill and strategy.

This project gave me the chance to experiment, learn, and grow while bringing these passions together into one creation.

🚧 Development Notes
Challenges & next steps:

Implementing a playlist system for background music (currently plays but not chained seamlessly).

Adding animated models for more immersive gameplay.

Packaging with PyInstaller required troubleshooting dependency inclusion—valuable learning experience.
